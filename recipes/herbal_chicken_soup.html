    <p>
      Chinese Herbal Chicken Soup is the ultimate soul food for Chinese people.
      Being savory, but not overly salty, not too decadent or heavy, it is
      perfect for a pick-me-up, whether for a hangover, or as a meal when you
      are sick, the smooth flavors with subtle sweet and earthy undertones from
      the herbal additions are perfectly soothing when you need it the most.

      <li>2 1/2 cups fresh young coconut juice</li>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse all herbs (astragalus roots, dried Chinese yams, angelica
        sinensis, goji berries and red dates) under water to remove dirt. Soak
        in water for 5-10 minutes, then drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub chicken/ cornish hen with a lot of salt and rinse under water to
        clean it. Or you can parboil it in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a clean pot, add cornish hen, ginger, garlic, coconut juice and
        water. Bring to a boil and skim off any foam. Reduce heat to a simmer
        and add all the medicinal herbs and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt (or to
        taste).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently simmer for 40-45 minutes, or to desired strength of the soup and
        tenderness of the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and garnish with sliced scallions.</li>
    </ol>
