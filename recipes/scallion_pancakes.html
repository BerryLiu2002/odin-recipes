    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pancakes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting work surface</li>
      <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
      <li>Up to 1/4 cup toasted sesame seed oil</li>
      <li>2 cups thinly sliced scallions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chinkiang or rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon finely sliced scallion greens</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place flour in bowl of food processor. With processor running, slowly
        drizzle in about 3/4 of the boiling water. Process for 15 seconds. If
        dough does not come together and ride around the blade, drizzle in more
        water a tablespoon at a time until it just comes together.
        (Alternatively, in a large bowl add flour and 3/4 of the boiling water.
        Stir with a wooden spoon or chopsticks until dough comes together,
        adding water a tablespoon at a time as needed.) Transfer to a floured
        work surface and knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a
        bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and allow to rest for 30
        minutes at room temperature, or up to overnight in the fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into four even pieces and shape each into a smooth ball.
        Working one ball at a time, roll out into a disk roughly 8-inches in
        diameter on a lightly floured surface. Using a pastry brush, paint a
        very thin layer of sesame oil over the top of the disk. Roll disk up
        like a jelly roll, then twist roll into a tight spiral, tucking the end
        underneath. Flatten gently with your hand, then re-roll into an 8-inch
        disk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paint with another layer of sesame oil, sprinkle with 1/2 cup scallions,
        and roll up like a jelly roll again. Twist into a spiral, flatten
        gently, and re-roll into a 7-inch disk. Repeat steps two and three with
        remaining dough balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together sauce ingredients and set aside at room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in an 8-inch nonstick, carbon steel, or cast-iron pan over
        medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully slip pancake into hot oil.
        Cook, shaking pan gently, until first side is an even golden brown
        (about 2 minutes). Carefully flip with tongs (be careful not to splash
        the oil), and continue to cook, shaking pan gently, until second side is
        an even golden brown (about 2 minutes longer). Transfer to a paper
        towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt and cut into 6 wedges.
        Repeat with remaining 3 pancakes. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
