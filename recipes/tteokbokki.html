    <h3>
      A classic Korean dish- full of savory and sweet notes soaked up by springy
      rice cakes
    </h3>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tteokbokki is a common Korean streetfood item. Key ingredients such as
      anchovies, jochujang (spicy pepper paste), and sugar contribute to its
      classic savory, spicy and sweet flavor profile. Often paired with
      cylindrical rice cakes, fish cake, eggs and scallions, this is one that is
      often synonymous with Korean culture and cuisine.

      <li>60g / 2 ounces onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tteokbokki Sauce (Mix in a bowl)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Garnish</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tsp roasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 stalk green onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Unless your rice cakes are soft already, soak them in warm water for 10
        mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high heat and dissolve
        the tteokbokki sauce by stirring it with a spatula. Once the seasoned
        stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes and onion. Boil them a
        further 3 to 5 mins until the rice cakes are fully cooked. Then, to
        thicken the sauce and to deepen the flavor, simmer it over low heat for
        a further 2 to 4 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir.
        Serve warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leftover tteokbokki can be refrigerated for a day or two. When
        reheating, add some spare soup stock or water. Though it won’t be as
        saucy as the first time.
